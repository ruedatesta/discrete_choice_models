# Discrete Choice Dynamic Programming

This is a repository with some codes written in Julia in order to solve for standard discrete choice models.

Please, notice this is a *work-in-progress*. 

The structure of this notebook is divided into 5 lectures.
- [The Logit Model](https://github.com/ruedatesta/discrete_choice_models/blob/main/lec1_logit.ipynb)
- [The Logit Model solved by simulation](https://github.com/ruedatesta/discrete_choice_models/blob/main/lec2_logit.ipynb)
- [The Probit Model](https://github.com/ruedatesta/discrete_choice_models/blob/main/lec3_probit.ipynb)
- [Dynamic Probit Model with two choices](https://github.com/ruedatesta/discrete_choice_models/blob/main/lec4_dynamic_probit.ipynb)
- Dynamic Probit Model with more than two choices

# Discrete Choice Dynamic Programming

This is a repository with some codes written in Julia in order to solve for standard discrete choice models.

Please, notice this is a *work-in-progress*. 

The structure of this notebook is divided into 5 lectures.
- [The Logit Model](https://github.com/ruedatesta/discrete_choice_models/blob/main/logit_lec1.ipynb)
- [The Logit Model solved by simulation](https://github.com/ruedatesta/discrete_choice_models/blob/main/logit_lec2.ipynb)
- [The Probit Model](https://github.com/ruedatesta/discrete_choice_models/blob/main/probit_lec3.jl)
- Dynamic Probit Model with dichotomous choices.
- Dynamic Probit Model with more than two choices.

# Discrete Choice Dynamic Programming

This is a repository with some codes written in Julia in order to solve for standard discrete choice models.

The structure of this notebook is divided into 5 lectures.
- The Logit Model.
- The Logit Model solved by simulation.
- The Probit Model.
- Dynamic Probit Model with dichotomous choices.
- Dynamic Probit Model with more than two choices.

If an agent $n$ chooses to work, she achieves a utility that is a function of her education attainment $x$ plus a working-related shock. The parameter $\\beta$ indicates the premium for each year of education, a parameter we are interested in recover it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The utility of not-working can be written as a fixed component $\\mu$ plus a leisure-related idiosyncratic shock. The fixed component can be interpreted as unemployment insurance and for simplicity, we are assuming it does not vary between agents. This assumption can be relaxed easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shock $\\varepsilon_{nj}$, $j=\\{0,1\\}$ is i.i.d. and choice specific, meaning that the agent face as many shocks as decisions she can choose from. In this model, we are going to assume that these idiosyncratic shocks come from standard Normal distrubution."
